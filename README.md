In this project, an application was developed using React and Redux available at [link](https://carinacunha.github.io/wallist/). This application works as a digital wallet to control expenses and have a home page where the user login and at this moment the email and password format is validated. The user is then redirected to the wallet page, where it is possible to manage (add, edit and delete) expenses in different currencies and view the total expenses converted to a currency of choice.
To perform the currency exchange search, data from the [awesomeapi Quotations API](https://economia.awesomeapi.com.br/json/all) is used.

Application validation was done using the React Testing Library.

**This project was developed during the Web Developer course at Trybe.**
